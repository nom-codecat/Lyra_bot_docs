# **Lyra Discord Bot \- Privacy Policy**

Last Updated: June 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Lyra Discord Bot ("Lyra," "the Bot," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and stores your information.

## **1\. Information We Collect**

Lyra operates in Direct Messages (DMs) with users. We primarily collect the following types of information:

* **Discord User ID:** Your unique Discord user ID is collected to store and retrieve your personal conversation history, personality settings, and custom personality prompts. This is essential for Lyra to remember you and your preferences across sessions.  
* **Conversation Content (Text):** All text messages you send to Lyra in DMs are stored as part of your conversation history. This allows Lyra to maintain context in ongoing conversations.  
* **Image Content (Attachments):** If you send images to Lyra in DMs as attachments, these images are saved to a local user\_memories/images/\<your\_user\_id\>/ directory on the server or computer running Lyra. This enables Lyra to process and remember visual context in your conversations.  
* **Personality Settings:** Your custom \!set\_persona traits (e.g., tone, verbosity) and your \!set\_custom\_persona free-form prompt are stored to customize Lyra's responses for you.  
* **Timestamps:** Timestamps are associated with your stored data (e.g., last\_updated in your user data file) to help manage and track data.

**We DO NOT collect:**

* Your Discord username (only your User ID is stored for data association).  
* Any information from Discord servers, channels, or messages where Lyra is not directly addressed or mentioned (unless Lyra is in a DM with you).  
* Any sensitive personal information (e.g., real name, address, email) unless you explicitly provide it in your messages. We strongly advise against sharing such information.

## **2\. How We Use Your Information**

Your collected information is used solely for the purpose of operating and improving Lyra's functionality for *you*:

* **Contextual Conversations:** Your conversation history (text and images) is used to provide context to the Google Generative AI model, enabling Lyra to understand your previous messages and maintain coherent discussions.  
* **Personalized Responses:** Your personality settings and custom personality prompt are used to tailor Lyra's tone, style, and behavior to your preferences.  
* **Data Management:** Your User ID is used to manage your individual data files (conversation history, personality settings, images) so that your data remains separate from other users'.  
* **No Commercial Use:** Your data is strictly for the functionality of Lyra and is NOT used for advertising, selling to third parties, or any other commercial purposes.

## **3\. Data Storage and Security**

* **Local Storage:** All your data (conversation history, personality settings, images) is stored locally on the machine where Lyra is being run, within the user\_memories directory. It is not stored on remote servers managed by the bot developer, unless the user explicitly downloads it and stores it elsewhere.  
* **Google Generative AI API:** When you interact with Lyra, your messages (text and images) and a synthesized "system instruction" based on your personality settings are sent to the Google Generative AI API for processing. Google's API usage policies apply to this data in transit and during processing for the purpose of generating responses. We do not retain this data on Google's servers beyond the immediate interaction necessary for a response.  
* **No End-to-End Encryption:** While data is stored locally, it is not encrypted by Lyra itself. The security of the data depends on the security of the device running the bot.  
* **Access Control:** The data files are typically accessible only to the owner of the machine running the bot.

## **4\. Your Data Rights**

You have full control over your data stored by Lyra:

* **\!download\_my\_data**: This command allows you to request a .zip file containing all your stored conversation history, personality settings, and images.  
* **\!delete\_my\_messages**: This command will delete only your text-based conversation history, while keeping your personality settings and images.  
* **\!delete\_my\_images**: This command will delete only your stored images, while keeping your conversation history and personality settings.  
* **\!delete\_all\_data**: This command will permanently delete ALL your conversation history, personality settings, custom personality prompt, and images. This action is irreversible.

To use these commands, simply send them as Direct Messages to Lyra. You will be prompted for confirmation for deletion commands.

## **5\. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## **6\. Contact Us**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or Lyra's data handling practices, please contact the bot developer directly via Discord.
