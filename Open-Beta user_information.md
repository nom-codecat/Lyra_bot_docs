### Feedback (Report bugs, your experience)

You can report bugs directly to the [Author]() or the [assistance]() on Discord. Alternatively, you can submit your feedback directly on [GitHub]() or by using our [User Feedback Form]().


**Note:** The slash commands may take a few minutes to appear after you first add the bot to your account. The [User Feedback Form]() form is primarily for feedback on usability, suggestions, and your overall experience with Lyra.
