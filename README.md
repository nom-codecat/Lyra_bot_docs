# Lyra: Security and Core Logic Examples

Welcome to the public code examples for Lyra, a private AI Discord bot.

This repository is designed to showcase Lyra's commitment to user data privacy and security. It is **not** the full source code for the bot.
Most snippets are mere examples, to showcase functionality and authenticity.

### Our Secure Architecture

As a small development team, we believe in transparency and want to provide a glimpse into the code that handles your most sensitive data. We've included well-commented snippets that demonstrate our secure architecture, including:

- **User-Specific Data Paths:** Our code ensures that each user's data is stored in a separate, isolated directory.
- **Industry-Standard Encryption:** We use `Fernet` encryption to protect all user data, both text and images, at rest.
- **Commitment to Privacy:** Our code is designed to never hard-code sensitive information like API keys or bot tokens.

### Lyra Beta Access

Officially, Lyra is in her 'open beta 2.0' testing phase, with no stable '1.0' release date currently set. (testing phase starts January 2026)

### For More Information

We believe in full transparency and encourage all users to review our official documentation and policies.
