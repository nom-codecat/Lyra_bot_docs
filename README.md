# Lyra: Security and Core Logic Examples

Welcome to the public code examples for Lyra, a private AI Discord bot.

This repository is designed to showcase Lyra's commitment to user data privacy and security. It is **not** the full source code for the bot.
Most snippets are mere examples, to showcase functionality and authenticity.

### Our Secure Architecture

As a small development team, we believe in transparency and want to provide a glimpse into the code that handles your most sensitive data. We've included well-commented snippets that demonstrate our secure architecture, including:

- **User-Specific Data Paths:** Our code ensures that each user's data is stored in a separate, isolated directory.
- **Industry-Standard Encryption:** We use `Fernet` encryption to protect all user data, both text and images, at rest.
- **Commitment to Privacy:** Our code is designed to never hard-code sensitive information like API keys or bot tokens.

### For More Information

We believe in full transparency and encourage all users to review our official documentation and policies.

We hope these examples provide confidence in our approach to data security. Thank you for using Lyra.

*exclaimer: as of now lyra is not discoverable on discord and in her beta, so in beta she's only available in dm's and you should expect bugs and Inconsistencies.
